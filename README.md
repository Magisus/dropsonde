# Dropsonde

A simple telemetry probe for gathering non-identifiable information about Puppet
infrastructures.


## Overview

We both know that you hate telemetry as much as I do. So what makes this different?
At its core, the purpose and design of this module is for your own benefit as much
as it is for ours. Think back to the time you last visited the Forge to find a
module. Chances are that you discovered many modules that claimed to solve your
problem and it was relatively difficult choosing between them. Surfacing usage
data in a way that lets you signal approval simply by using a module is the
primary goal of this project.

> **This means that the best way for you to help yourself find new modules is to
> install this telemetry tool and, along with your peers, share your module usage
> data.** âœ…


## Design

So what sort of information is gathered? Dropsonde identifies information like
which public modules and classes are used, and what platforms they're used on.
It identifies the component classes that your profile modules declares so we can
better support what you are doing with your profiles, *but without exposing your
profile names.* The key point here is that it looks for usage patterns for *public
modules only* and explicitly does its best to keep your internal code private to you.

You can see exactly what will be phoned home by running the command:

```
$ dropsonde preview
```

Dropsonde is a simple telemetry probe designed to run as a regular cron job.
Metrics are defined by plugins that gather data, but also export a schema that
constrains the data allowed to be reported on. Dropsonde will reject metrics
that don't meet these constraints. The backend database is also defined by this
schema so the system cannot gather any data that's not described in the schema.

See the full schema of all enabled plugins by running the command:

```
$ dropsonde schema
```

All information in the report is keyed off a non-reversible SHA512 hash site-id
to make it unidentifiable; this report cannot be linked back to you or to your
infrastructure. Now that said, we know that the more bits of data shared about a
specific site, the easier it is to fingerprint that site. See
[Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org) for a real-world example.

To mitigate this concern, we aggregate data in a two step process. The data
submitted by Dropsonde is stored in a private dataset. ACLs limit access to only
certain number of employees. Then each week, a job runs to generate a sanitized
and aggregated form of the data for the week which goes into the public dataset
that all our tooling actually depends on and uses. This dataset includes patterns
and aggregate data, but does not include any individual records whatsoever.

For example, this aggregated data might include records that show a count of how
many sites are using various combinations of modules together, but it will never
include a record showing the full list of modules that any single site is using.

With your own Google Cloud account, you can use that [dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=puppetlabs.com:api-project-53122606061)
in your own tooling and you can see/contribute to the aggregation queries in its
own [repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/dropsonde-aggregation).


## Privacy

Dropsonde will not collect the names or titles of internal modules, classes,
facts, types, etc. It will gather the names of the component classes that your
profiles use, but it will not gather the names of your profiles themselves. In
order to maintain data integrity, reports are keyed off a non-reversible site-id.
This means that there's no direct link from a record to you or your infrastructure,
but it does mean that the data could be used for fingerprinting. To mitigate that,
the data goes through an additional aggregation step that removes this ID and
presents only usage patterns publicly.

If you identify an unmitigated privacy concern then please inform us as soon as
possible: [privacy@puppet.com](mailto:privacy@puppet.com)


## Installation

This is distributed as a Ruby gem. Simply `gem install dropsonde`. There's a
[Puppet module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-dropsonde) to manage it
if that's more your thing.


## Configuration

Any command line arguments can also be specified in `/etc/puppetlabs/telemetry.yaml`.
For example the config file below will disable Forge module cache updating and
will not report the `:puppetfiles` metrics.


``` yaml
---
:update: false
:blacklist:
  - puppetfiles
```

The `puppetlabs-dropsonde` Puppet module manages this configuration for you.


## Running

Run `dropsonde --help` to see usage information.

* `preview`
    * Generate and print out an example telemetry report in human readable form
    * Annotated with descriptions of each plugin and each metric gathered.
* `schema`
    * Generate and print out the complete combined schema.
* `list`
    * See a quick list of the available metrics and what they do.
* `submit`
    * Generate and submit a telemetry report. This will be exactly the same as
      the human readable form, just in JSON format.
* `update`
    * Once a week, the list of public modules on the Forge will be updated. This
      command will manually force that cache update to happen.


## Architecture

Dropsonde is a simple telemetry probe designed to run as a regular cron job. It
will gather metrics defined by self-contained plugins that each defines its own
partial schema and then gathers the data to meet that schema.

Metrics plugins live in the `lib/dropsonde/metrics` directory. See the existing
examples for the API. All data returned must match the schema the plugin defines
and each column in the schema must be documented.

Dropsonde maintains a cache listing all the public modules existing on the Forge.
This is used for identifying public modules and ensuring that information about
your internal modules is not leaked outside your network. Once a week, this cache
of modules is updated.


## Limitations

This is super early in development and has not yet been battle tested.
